# Present Continuous for future arrangements

The present continuous is used to talk about **arrangements** for events at a time later than now. There is a suggestion that more than one person is aware of the event, and that some preparation has already happened.

* _**I'm meeting** Jim at the airport_ - Jim and I have discussed this.
* _**I'm leaving** tomorrow_ - I've already bought my train ticket.
* _**We're having** a staff meeting next Monday_ - all members of staff have been told about it.

> BE CAREFUL: the simple present is used when a future event is part of a programme or time-table.

Notice the difference:

* We're having a staff meeting next Monday - just that once.
* We have a staff meeting every Monday.
